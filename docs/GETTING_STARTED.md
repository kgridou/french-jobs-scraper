Enable and trigger the `french_jobs_pipeline` DAG!

## 📊 What Happens When Pipeline Runs

```
Step 1: Scrape Indeed.fr       (3-5 minutes)
Step 2: Scrape HelloWork        (3-5 minutes)  
Step 3: Validate Data           (30 seconds)
Step 4: Clean with Pandas       (1 minute)
Step 5: Enrich with Spark       (2 minutes)
Step 6: Load to PostgreSQL      (1 minute)
Step 7: Generate Analytics      (30 seconds)
Step 8: Quality Check           (10 seconds)

Total: ~15 minutes for first run
```

## 💡 Demo Workflow

### For Portfolio/Interview
1. **Show Architecture**: Open `STRUCTURE.md`
2. **Start Services**: `make start`
3. **Access UI**: Navigate to Airflow (localhost:8080)
4. **Trigger Pipeline**: Enable and run DAG
5. **Show Monitoring**: Real-time task execution
6. **Query Data**: `make db-shell` → Run analytics
7. **Explain Code**: Walk through scrapers, DAG, Spark job

### Live Demo Script
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start everything
make start
make logs-airflow

# Terminal 2: Trigger and monitor
make trigger-dag
# Watch in Airflow UI

# Terminal 3: Query results
make db-shell
SELECT source, COUNT(*) FROM jobs_data.jobs GROUP BY source;
```

## 📈 Sample Analytics

Once pipeline runs, try these queries in PostgreSQL:

```sql
-- Top 10 skills in demand
SELECT jsonb_array_elements_text(required_skills) as skill, 
       COUNT(*) as count
FROM jobs_data.jobs 
GROUP BY skill 
ORDER BY count DESC 
LIMIT 10;

-- Average salary by region
SELECT region, 
       AVG((salary_min + salary_max) / 2) as avg_salary
FROM jobs_data.jobs 
WHERE salary_min IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY region 
ORDER BY avg_salary DESC;

-- Remote vs On-site
SELECT remote_type, 
       COUNT(*) as jobs,
       ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (), 1) as percentage
FROM jobs_data.jobs 
GROUP BY remote_type;
```

More queries in `sql/analytics_queries.sql`!

## 🎨 Customization Ideas

### Easy Wins
- Change search query: Edit scrapers (`search_query="python developer"`)
- Add new location: Modify `location` parameter
- Change schedule: Edit `schedule_interval` in DAG

### Medium Complexity
- Add new job board: Copy `indeed_scraper.py`, modify for new site
- New analytics: Add queries to `analytics_queries.sql`
- Custom enrichment: Extend `enrich_jobs.py` Spark job

### Advanced
- Add email alerts: Configure Airflow email notifications
- API endpoint: Create FastAPI service on top of PostgreSQL
- Dashboard: Build Streamlit/Plotly visualization dashboard
- ML model: Train classifier for job quality/salary prediction

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Services won't start
```bash
make logs           # Check error messages
docker ps -a        # See container status
make clean          # Nuclear option - full reset
```

### Pipeline fails
```bash
make logs-airflow   # Detailed Airflow logs
# Check specific task logs in Airflow UI
# Review code in failed task
```

### Port conflicts (8080 already in use)
Edit `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
airflow-webserver:
  ports:
    - "8090:8080"  # Change external port
```

### Out of memory
- Increase Docker memory to 8GB+ in Docker Desktop settings
- Reduce `max_pages` in scraper tasks
- Process fewer jobs per run

## 🎓 Learning Path

1. **Understand the Flow**: Read `STRUCTURE.md`
2. **Run Pipeline**: Follow `QUICKSTART.md`
3. **Read Code**: Start with `french_jobs_pipeline.py`
4. **Modify Scraper**: Change search terms, test locally
5. **Explore Data**: Run analytics queries
6. **Extend**: Add new features (scraper, analytics, etc.)
