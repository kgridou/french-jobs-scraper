## 📊 Data Collected

Each job posting includes:
- Title, company, location
- Salary information (when available)
- Job description
- Category, contract type, experience level
- Remote work type
- Required skills
- Posting date

## 🔧 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker 20.10+
- Docker Compose 2.0+
- 4GB+ RAM

### Quick Start
```bash
cd french-jobs-scraper
make init        # Initialize project
make build       # Build Docker images
make up          # Start all services
```

Access services:
- Airflow UI: http://localhost:8080 (airflow/airflow)
- Spark UI: http://localhost:8081
- PostgreSQL: localhost:5432 (airflow/airflow)

### Run Pipeline
1. Open Airflow UI
2. Enable `french_jobs_pipeline` DAG
3. Trigger manually or wait for scheduled run

## 📈 Use Cases

### Analytics Queries
- Top paying companies and locations
- Salary trends by experience level
- Most in-demand skills
- Remote work statistics
- Job market trends

### Sample Query
```sql
SELECT 
    category, 
    location, 
    AVG(salary_avg) as avg_salary,
    COUNT(*) as job_count
FROM vw_job_summary
WHERE posting_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY category, location
ORDER BY avg_salary DESC;
```

## 📝 Notes

### Ethical Scraping
- Respects robots.txt
- Implements rate limiting
- Doesn't overload servers
- For educational purposes

### LinkedIn Scraping
LinkedIn scraping is disabled by default as it typically requires authentication. Focus is on Indeed.fr which is more accessible.

### PostgreSQL JDBC Driver
For Spark-PostgreSQL connectivity, you may need to:
1. Download the PostgreSQL JDBC driver
2. Place it in the Spark jars directory
3. Or use the `--packages` option in spark-submit

See SETUP_NOTES.md for details.

## 🎯 Success Metrics

After running the pipeline, you should see:
- ✅ Jobs scraped and stored in database
- ✅ Data cleaned and processed with Pandas
- ✅ Analytics generated with Spark
- ✅ Quality checks passed
- ✅ Summary report generated
